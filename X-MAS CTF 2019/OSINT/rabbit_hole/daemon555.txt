THIS FILE IS OBVIOUSLY ABOUT WRITING T-FILES.  TO WRITE A T-FILE, YOU NEED
THESE THINGS:

1.  YOU NEED AN APPLE //E OR //C WITH UPPER & LOWER CASE...
    (USING A II+ IS REALLY A PAIN.)  AN APPLE ISN'T NECESSARY, BUT REAL
    TEXTFILE WRITERS DONT USE ANYTHING BUT THE BEST...

2.  YOU NEED AN 80 COLUMN CARD.

3.  YOU NEED THE ABILITY TO STRETCH OUT WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SAY SO THAT
    THE FILE TAKES LONGER TO V)IEW AND TAKES UP MORE DISK SPACE.  A TEXTFILE
    SHOULD BE AT LEAST 15 SECTORS, BUT ITS BEST IF ITS OVER 20.
    EXAMPLE:

      YOU WANT TO SAY:
	  WRITING T-FILES IS A PAIN...

      IN A T-FILE YOU WOULD SAY IT LIKE THIS:
	  WRITING A TEXTFILE IS A VERY TIME-CONSUMING AND ARDUOUS TASK.
	  IT TAKES A LOT OF THOUGHT AND IS VERY WEARING ON A PERSON.  IT
	  IS NOT AT ALL EASY.
      AND THEN YOU ELABORATE ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

4.  YOU NEED THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN AND KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE
    CENTER IS SO THAT YOU CAN CENTER GARBAGE.
    EX.
			       ->VVVVVVVVV<-
			       -> GARBAGE <-
			       ->^^^^^^^^^<-

    I DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY, BUT SOMETIMES I GET LUCKY.

5.  YOU NEED TO THE ABILITY TO MIX DIFFERENT CHARACTERS IN AN APPEALLING
    WAY TO MAKE A BORDER FOR THE TITLE.
    EX.
	+^+^+^+^+^+^+	    ><><><><><><>
	^+  HELLO  +^	    <>	HELLO  <>
	+^+^+^+^+^+^+	    ><><><><><><>

		  (^^^^^^^^^^^)
		   )  HELLO  (
		  (^^^^^^^^^^^)

	    ><L>  THE LOCKSMITH  <S><

V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V
    AND STUFF LIKE THAT.  THERE ARE A LOT MORE, BUT THEY'RE HARD TO MAKE
    ON AN APPLE II+ SINCE A II+ DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE CHARATERS ON THE
    KEYBOARD.

6.  YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF PATIENCE.  YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TYPE FOR
    HOURS AT A TIME.  IF YOU TYPE FAST ENOUGH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
    ABOUT THIS STEP.

7.  IT HELPS IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE NEON KNIGHTS
    OF METALAND.
    ><> THOSE GUYS WRITE THE BEST T-FILES <><

8.  ITS HELPFUL TO HAVE A GOOD WORD PROCESSOR, BUT AE WILL DO THE JOB GOOD
    ENOUGH.  AE HAS ONE OF THE BEST TEXT EDITORS.

9.  IT HELPS A LOT IF YOU ARE DRUNK AND TO HAVE MUSIC BLASTING IN YOUR EARS
    IN STEREO.	I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT THATS JUST THE WAY IT WORKS.


    WRITE A TEXT FILE AND GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE WITH A MODEM, BUT THATS
    KIND OF A PAIN.




NOW HERE IS A LIST OF NON-NECESSITIES:


1.  CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEEL STUPH RITE.
    SPEELINK ERRURS AR VARY COMON.

2.  YOU DON'T NEED A 1200 BAUD APPLE-CAT UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW HOW  TO
    STRETCH OUT WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SAY.  USUALLY ANY 300 BAUD MODEM
    WILL WORK FINE.

3.  YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE WRITING YOUR TEXTFILE
    ABOUT IF YOU CAN MAKE IT UP AS YOU GO ALONG.

4.  YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A -REAL PIRATE-, BUT IT HELPS.  YOU ALSO DON'T -HAVE-
    TO BE STONED, BUT IT HELPS.

5.  AND YOU DEFINATELY DON'T NEED A HIGH I.Q., BUT I HEAR THAT IT HELPS.
